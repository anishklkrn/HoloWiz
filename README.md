# HoloWiz
This project uses inbuilt speech to text, text to speech, and Google Dialogflow assets to create an interactive hologram.
Import assests file into unity and open the SampleScene in Scenes. 
You can change the AppID to your personal DialogFlow agent which can be found on the settings page in finalscript, also present in Assets. One can also use individual scenes in each of the folders present in Assets to use some part of the project. 
The speech to text uses DictationRecognizer whose suitable codes can be found in the finalscript.
Make your agent here : www.dialogflow.com
